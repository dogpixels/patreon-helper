# Patreon Helper
Downloads media as you browse Patreon, so you don't have to do this manually.

# Requirements
* Firefox 57+

# Installation
Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/patreon-helper/ and click "Add to Firefox".

# Usage
Simply browse Patreon as you usually would, ideally a content creator's monthly submissions. No need to click on media to open the full version. Downloads will be stored in your download directors (from your Firefox settings) and into a sub-folder simply labeled "patreon".

Note that downloads are slowed down to one file every few seconds to reduce server load for Patreon.
